# CS50

This is reposytory for all cs50 problem sets in cs50 course.

Please note that you must write your own code. Do not blindly copy this as it is against CS50's integrity policy.
This repo is mainly for check purpose, so take your time and try to solve these problems on your own (it will give much more knowledge and satisfaction than just completing the course without any hard work :) ) 

Policy:
"The essence of all work that you submit to this course must be your own. Unless otherwise specified, collaboration on assessments (e.g., assignments, labs, problem sets, projects, quizzes, or tests) is not permitted except to the extent that you may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you. Generally speaking, when asking for help, you may show your work to others, but you may not view theirs, so long as you and they respect this policyâ€™s other constraints."
